  title={Nutrition Demand, Subsistence Farming, and Agricultural Productivity},
  author={Gordeev, Stepan},
  abstract = {In many of the poorest countries, agriculture is unproductive and subsistence farming is widespread. I propose nutrition demand as a mechanism that drives the production decisions of subsistence farmers and ultimately contributes to low aggregate agricultural productivity. I explore this mechanism in a model of farm-operating households facing explicit caloric needs and costly domestic trade, and test the model's predictions on Malawian household-level data. In the model and in the data, the smallest farmers focus their consumption on obtaining calories and specialize their production in unsold staple crops; medium farmers diversify both their diet and their subsistence production; the largest farmers shift consumption to purchased goods by producing and selling marketable farm products. I quantify the aggregate implications of this farm-level product choice using the model. It suggests that lowering trade frictions enough for the average share of output sold by farmers to reach even 50% would make the country's agricultural sector 42% more productive. Half of this increase is caused by the mechanically reduced erosion of output, and the other half by a better alignment of individual farmers' product choice with their comparative advantage rather than their family's nutritional needs or food preferences.},

  title={Intangible Capital, Tangible Misallocation},
  author={Gordeev, Stepan},
  abstract = {The role of intangible capital in production is growing relative to conventional capital. This paper considers the implications of this shift on the misallocation of inputs across public US firms. I show that ignoring intangibles leads to an overestimation of misallocation costs by 54\%. The degree of this overestimation gets worse over time, which explains most of the measured deterioration in allocative efficiency in the US in recent years. I find that misallocation is almost twice as severe in sectors that use comparatively more intangibles as in sectors relying more on tangible capital. I calibrate a variable markup model in which the outcome of intangible investments is uncertain and markups increase with firm productivity. I find that it can generate a significant portion of the measured misallocation.},
