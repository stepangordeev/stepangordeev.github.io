  title={Nutrition Demand, Subsistence Farming, and Agricultural Productivity},
  author={Gordeev, Stepan},
  abstract = {Subsistence farming is prevalent in many of the poorest countries. I study the role that the nutrition demand of subsistence farmers can play in determining the production decisions of individual farms, and ultimately the aggregate agricultural output and productivity. I propose demand for dietary energy and demand for dietary variety as two nutritional driving forces. If a farm is able to overcome trading obstacles, it will specialize in its comparative advantage. Otherwise, it will tailor its production to satisfy its own demand for nutrition, with the energy channel dominating for small farms, leading to specialization in calorie production, and the variety channel dominating for larger ones, leading to diversification in edible goods. I find evidence of this mechanism in a rich survey of Malawian households. I build a model of subsistence farming with costly trade and explicit demand for nutrition, show that it is consistent with several salient features of the data, and use it to determine the role that this mechanism can play in depressing the aggregate agricultural productivity of a country.},

  title={Intangible Capital, Tangible Misallocation},
  author={Gordeev, Stepan},
  abstract = {The role of intangible capital in production is growing relative to conventional capital. This paper considers the implications of this shift on the misallocation of inputs across public US firms. I show that ignoring intangibles leads to an overestimation of misallocation costs by 54\%. The degree of this overestimation gets worse over time, which explains most of the measured deterioration in allocative efficiency in the US in recent years. I find that misallocation is almost twice as severe in sectors that use comparatively more intangibles as in sectors relying more on tangible capital. I calibrate a variable markup model in which the outcome of intangible investments is uncertain and markups increase with firm productivity. I find that it can generate a significant portion of the measured misallocation.},
