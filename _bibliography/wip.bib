  title={Identity, Trade, and Misallocation},
  author={Gordeev, Stepan and Singh, Sudhir},
  abstract = {
   Economic and non-economic transactions in Indian society are often influenced by caste. The trade of goods and services is more likely to occur within the same caste than across different castes. Such restrictive transactions generate inefficiency in the local market and affect the economic outcomes of households and the overall welfare of society. This study explores the prevalence and consequences of these identity-based transactional patterns, particularly within the agricultural sector. Leveraging a rich dataset comprising detailed transaction-level information from India, we rigorously quantify the misallocative effects of caste-related friction. First, we document widespread caste-based transactions in the local market. Then, to assess the malleability of these caste-related frictions, we utilize exogenous economic shocks as natural experiments within local markets. This allows us to investigate the potential for reducing or permeating caste-based barriers to trade, shedding light on the adaptability of identity to external economic shocks.
