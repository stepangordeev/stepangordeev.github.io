@article{GordeevSingh2023ProductionFunctionHeterogeneity,
  title={Input-Driven Production Technology Heterogeneity and Misallocation},
  author={Gordeev, Stepan and Singh, Sudhir},
  abstract = {We study whether heterogeneity in the intrinsic features of production inputs may generate heterogeneity in production technologies optimally chosen by firms, leading existing estimates of misallocation to overstate its costs. Existing estimates of the severity of misallocation of inputs across firms rely on assuming homogeneous production technology and interpreting deviations from that technology as evidence of misallocative distortions. We use a state-of-the-art clustering algorithm for ordinal data to group Indian agricultural plots into land types by the intrinsic physical features of each plot. We find that production functions are significantly heterogenous across land types, which we confirm with placebo-like randomization inference. This suggests that some types of land are better suited to land-intensive technology, others to labor-intensive technology, etc. We build a model in which heterogeneous farmers face distortions and rent land of several types. We use the model to quantify the cost of misallocation for India's aggregate agricultural productivity and compare it to conventional models that assume homogeneous production technology.}

@article{GordeevSingh2023CasteMisallocation,
  title={Caste Identity, Trade, and Misallocation},
  author={Gordeev, Stepan and Singh, Sudhir},
  abstract = {We study the interaction between caste identity and misallocation. In India, the caste dictates individuals' choices, permeating every facet of their economic and social lives. It may limit the exchange of inputs and outputs across castes, leading to inefficiencies in local markets. Using rich transaction-level data from India, we quantify the relationship between existing caste relations within a village and the quality of input allocation between farms. Next, we build a model combining identity preference and trading partner matching with farm-level misallocation. Finally, we test whether economic shocks can lead to lasting changes in identity preferences and inter-caste relations.}

@article{GordeevSteinbach2023DeterminantsPTADesign,
  title={Determinants of PTA Design: Insights from Machine Learning},
  author={Gordeev, Stepan and Steinbach, Sandro},
  abstract = {Preferential Trade Agreements (PTAs) have emerged as the dominant form of international trade governance. Provisions included in PTAs are increasingly numerous, broad in their purview, deep in their scope, and varied between agreements. We study the economic, political, and geographic determinants of PTA design differences. For each of the hundreds of classified PTA provisions, we consider hundreds of country-pair characteristics as potential determinants, covering many individual mechanisms the literature has studied. To deal with this high-dimensionality and complexity, we employ Random Forests, a supervised machine learning technique. We use a robust variable importance measure to identify the most important determinants of the inclusion of each PTA provision. Contagion due to competition for export markets, geographic proximity, and governance quality emerge as the most important determinants of PTA design.}

@article{GordeevJelliffeKimSteinbach2023WhatMattersForAgriculturalTrade,
  title={What Matters for Agricultural Trade? Assessing the Role of Trade Deal Provisions using Machine Learning},
  author={Gordeev, Stepan and Jelliffe, Jeremy and Kim, Dongin and Steinbach, Sandro},
  abstract = {This paper applies machine learning methods to identify provisions in preferential trade agreements (PTAs) that enhance agricultural trade and to determine the socio-economic and political factors influencing their inclusion. Using a theory-consistent three-way gravity model, we employ Lasso regularized regression to identify PTA provisions impacting agricultural trade. The Lasso estimates highlight the relevance of competition policies, export taxes, intellectual property rights, capital movement, state enterprises, and technical trade barriers. Next, we employ Random Forests to determine the economic, political, social, and geographic factors driving the inclusion of these PTA provisions. The results emphasize the importance of contagion, governance quality, energy use, and geographic proximity.}
