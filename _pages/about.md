I am a Postdoctoral Research Associate at the University of Connecticut. I completed my Ph.D. in Economics at the University of Rochester in 2022.

My research is at the intersection of macroeconomics and development.

I strive to understand the role that the heterogeneous behavior of individual firms and households responding to their unique constraints plays in determining the aggregate development path of the economy. 

**I will be on the 2023/2024 job market.**
