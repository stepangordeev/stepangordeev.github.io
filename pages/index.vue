            <p> I am an Assistant Professor of Economics at Texas Christian University. I completed my Ph.D. in Economics at the University of Rochester in 2022 and served as a Postdoctoral Research Associate at the University of Connecticut in 2022â€“2024.

            <p>
            My research is at the intersection of macroeconomics and development.
            </p>
            <p>I strive to understand the role that the heterogeneous behavior of individual firms and households responding to their unique constraints plays in determining the aggregate development path of the economy.
